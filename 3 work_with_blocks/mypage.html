                        <h1>Hungry Games</h1>
                        <p>
                            Development of The Hunger Games began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment
                            entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force, which had acquired the
                            rights a few weeks earlier.
                            Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded
                            the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow.

                        <h1>Hobbit</h1>
                        <p>
                            The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh,
                            Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to
                            direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage).
                            The films also expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material
                            Thorin and his ancestors. The film is reccemended by critics.

                            Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts.
                            There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go where no man has gone before,
                            a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life.
