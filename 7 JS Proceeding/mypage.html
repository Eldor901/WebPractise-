                    <p>
                        Development of The Hunger Games began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force, which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay.
                        The screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow.

                        Earth's future has been riddled by disasters, famines, and droughts. There is only one way to ensure mankind's survival: Interstellar travel. A newly discovered wormhole in the far reaches of our solar system allows a team of astronauts to go where no
                        man has gone before, a planet that may have the right environment to sustain human life.Interstellar premiered on October 26, 2014, in Los Angeles, California. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding
                        to venues using digital projectors. The film had a worldwide gross of over $677 million.

                        The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning
                        of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage). The films also
                        expand upon certain elements from the novel and other source material Thorin and his ancestors. The film is reccemended by critics.

                            <h1>Raid</h1>
                            <p>RAID consists of data mirroring, without parity or striping. Data is written identically to two drives, thereby producing a "mirrored set" of drives. Thus, any read request can be serviced by any drive in the set. If a request is broadcast
                                to every drive in the set, it can be serviced by the drive that accesses the data first (depending on its seek time and rotational latency), improving performance.Sustained read throughput, if the controller or software is optimized
                                for it, approaches the sum of throughputs of every drive in the set, just as for RAID 0. Actual read throughput of most RAID 1 implementations is slower than the fastest drive. Write throughput is always slower because every drive
                                must be updated, and the slowest drive limits the write performance. The array continues to operate as long as at least one drive is functioning.
